* **[Encrypted Integers]** - A groupe of classes for storing an integer while efficiently keeping it encrypted in the memory. In the memory it is saved as a floating-point number that is affected by random values. { encryptionKey1 & encryptionKey2 } You can also reset the key's value with a method.
