A class for storing an int while efficiently keeping it encrypted in the memory.
* **[EncryptionTools]** class - 
Not a class you should use. But it is a requirement to have it if you want to use the EncryptedInt class.
Just copy it with EncryptedInt and forget about it. This is just a static class the EncryptedInt class uses to get a random float.
