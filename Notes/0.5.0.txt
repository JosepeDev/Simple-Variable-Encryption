Version 0.5.0 - Release Notes

# New Encrypted Types

* EncFloat - A type for containing a "Single" type (a float).
  Exactly the same concept as the EncInt struct.

* EncDouble - A type for containing a "Double" type.
  Exactly the same concept as the struct above.

* EncDecimal - A type for containing a "Decimal" type.
  Exactly the same concept as the struct above.

* EncString - An EncType class for a string type,
  that uses a XOR bitwise encryption.

# Classes and Structs INDEPENDENCIE

	I all previous version, all the classes, the structs and the EncTypes depend on the EncryptionTools.
	A class that had methods for getting random numbers. Now there's no need for that.
	Each and every single **EncType** now is **independent** and can work alone.

# Benchmark Application

	The VarEnc repo now contains a benchmark (exe)cutable to test the efficiency of it’s types.
	When it’s running, the application will perform two benchmarks on the types you chose.
	Each benchmark contains a certain amount tests, and in each test,
	the application will change a value of certain variable-type a certain amount of time.

- If it sound complicated, don't worry. It is very simple and it has a full page in the WIKI (:

	You can lunch the Benchmark executable from the "Benchmark" library.
	You can also build the benchmark executable yourself with the Solution contained in the repo.

# Removed classes

- 	EncryptionTools, this class contained methods for getting a random variable.
	This was completely redundant and made unnecessary dependencies.
	
- 	EncryptedInt, this class was the first in this project. 
	Now it's useless with the new Enc structs.
