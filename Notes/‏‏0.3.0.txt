Version 0.3.0 Release Notes

- Changed the license from "MIT" to "GPL-3.0"
- Added Encrypted Integer Structures
	A group of structures for storing an integer while efficiently keeping it encrypted in the memory.
	In the memory it is saved as a floating-point number that is affected by random values. { encryptionKey1 & encryptionKey2 }
	Every time the value changes, the encryption keys change too. And it works exactly as an int.
	
* eint - A struct for storing a 32-bit integer while efficiently keeping it encrypted in the memory.
